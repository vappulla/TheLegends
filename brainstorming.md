## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize
1. Security
  
   - **Category:** Security
   - **Mobile:** The product is a security app to protect user information for the device. It is only applicable to the device.
   - **Story:** The value is very clear: mobile security. I think anyone would want something like this for the safety of their private information.
   - **Market:** Anyone with a phone is a potential user of this app, so the audience for this app is essentially every android user. 
   - **Habit:** It shouldn't be addicting simply because the app itself will only give security statistics on how its helped enforce security standards on a user's phone. The user simply sees these statistics, their is no ceration of any sort.
   - **Scope:** The app is technically challenging, and it may be difficult to finish the app by the deadline. The app is similar to many antivirus apps available like Bitdefender Mobile Security, so the constraints are well defined.

1. Games
  
   - **Category:** Games
   - **Mobile:** Experince of a mobile game unique due to device's touch interface, and portability.
   - **Story:** Games can be played as multiplayer among you friends and have a fun time with everyone. So peers would be very supportive of this idea since they get to spend more time with each other.
   - **Market:** The market for the mobile games is massive and continues to grow rapidly. With millions of smartphone users worldwide there is no need to worry about the app's success.
   - **Habit:** The mobile games often use addictive gameplay mechanics to keep players coming back for more. For example, features like daily challenges, rewards, and friendly competintion encourages for regular enagagement.
   - **Scope:**  Devloping a mobile game app can be technically difficult, especially as it involves like complex graphical designs and multiplayer networking. However, if we are strating with like minimum viable product it make our task a bit easier to manage our scope. And for that we have to priotize like features that we are going to work on and focus on that. We have to have like a clear vision and like a timeline to achieve this task without any problem.

1. Music
  
   - **Category:** Music
   - **Mobile:** The app can function as a music player on the go, so people can listen to songs while outside their home.
   - **Story:** Being able to listen to music anywhere u want is a great value add for any music lover's day-to-day life. Friends and peers would be very supportive of this idea and would want to use the app.
   - **Market:** Any music lover can use this app to its fullest effect and provides huge value to a large group of people (people who like music)
   - **Habit:** This app would be quite addictive for people who love listening to music and would allow them to listen to their favorite songs and albums whenever they want. A user can just listen to the music; only verified music artists can create something on this app.
   - **Scope:** This app will be difficult to implement in the deadline, as their is a massive library of songs and albums that need to be integrated into the app to be usable. A stripped down version with a smaller amount of songs is still interesting, however. This product is very similar to an app already on the market, Spotify, and so the definitions of the app are quite clear-cut.
