## Summary

This document provides a summary of our project building process for our app, **To kickstart our app development, we established a Discord chat and organized our work on Git. We then divided our team into two groups: one focusing on the RecyclerView and its associated features, and the other on the Login page. Each group consisted of three members. We scheduled regular meetings on Fridays at 4 pm in the respective Discord voice channels to collaborate and finalize the features. Brandon took charge of implementing the RecyclerView, including elements such as title, name, defense, attack, HP, and MP. Varshini handled the implementation of the clicker function, and sign-out button, and ensured that champion images appeared on the RecyclerView. Kacey, Hugo, and Tommy collaborated on the development of the login page. Both Kacey and Varshini contributed to the styling aspect of the app.**
